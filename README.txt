PCBMaker is an application for PC and android that allows to design small and very space constrained circuits, to be fabricated using a CNC machine.

The program shows an empty grid. Every cell and their sides can be populated with cuts, pockets and holes to compose a PCB. If the size of a single cell is changed,
it will affect the rest of cells in the same column/row.

Circuits created, can be saved, edited and exported to GCode
