**PCBMaker** is a custom application for PC and android to allow me to design small and very space constrained circuits to be fabricated using the CNC machine.

The program shows an empty grid. Every cell and their sides can be populated with cuts, pockets and holes to compose a PCB. If the size of a single cell is changed,
it will affect the rest of cells in the same column/row.

The circuits created, can be saved, edited and exported to GCode
